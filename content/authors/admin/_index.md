I am a PhD student at [LIPN](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/), working under the supervision of [Joseph Leroux](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~leroux/). My grant is part of the [PARSITI](https://anr.fr/en/funded-projects-and-impact/funded-projects/project/funded/project/b2d9d3668f92a3b9fbbf7866072501ef-43ddacb159/?tx_anrprojects_funded%5Bcontroller%5D=Funded&cHash=b64962ed2dd408fd110e35e193667779) project. I am mostly interested in the applications of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) on Natural Language processing. As such, I work on semi-supervised learning with deep latent variable models, disentanglement, and denoising.
