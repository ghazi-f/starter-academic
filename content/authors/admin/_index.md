I am a Doctor in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, and I am currenlty building conversational agents within [ViaDialog](https://viadialog.com/) while minimizing human intervention in the design of these agents. I am mostly interested in Language Models, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), interpretable Language Modeling and, more generally, Natural Language Processing. 

I was previously a PhD student at [LIPN](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/) supervised by [Joseph Le Roux](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~leroux/) and co-supervised by [Djamé Seddah](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~seddah/), and a lab supervisor for the course [Machine Learning for NLP](https://nlp-ensae.github.io/) at ENSAE-IPP. 

Further in the past, I was working closely with [Leo Hemamou](https://lhemamou.github.io/)  to try and help the Human Ressources industry with fair, [IO Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology)-based Machine Learning models.
